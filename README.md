# MrWorldWideMcHacks2018
A travel buddy to avoid roaming charges oversees, connecting users to the ressources of the internet over text message.

This is a project that was built over the course of 24 hours at McHacks 2018 built by 4 McGill and Concordia Students. Due to issues with Git (learning how to plan a big project and work with Git in teams), the original project with revision history was lost. This is a backup to demonstrate the work that went into the project.
